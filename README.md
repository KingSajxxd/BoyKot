# Boykot

Boykot is a Flutter-based mobile application designed to help users identify brands to boycott. The app relies on data scraped from public sources to provide up-to-date information on various companies and products.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into two main components:

- **`app/`**: A Flutter mobile application that displays the boycott data.
- **`backend/`**: Python scripts used to scrape and generate the data consumed by the app.

## Backend

The backend consists of Python scripts that scrape data from `disoccupied.com` and format it for the mobile app.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `pip`

### Setup & Usage

1.  Navigate to the `backend` directory:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```

2.  Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  Run the scraper to generate the latest data:
    ```bash
    python full_disoccupied_scraper.py
    ```

    This script will:
    - Scrape data from the configured sources.
    - Save the data to `../app/assets/boycott_data.json`.
    - Download relevant brand logos to `../app/assets/images`.

## Mobile App

The mobile app is built with Flutter and consumes the JSON data generated by the backend.

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK (version 3.9.2 or higher compatible)
- Dart SDK

### Setup & Usage

1.  Navigate to the `app` directory:
    ```bash
    cd app
    ```

2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```

3.  Run the app:
    ```bash
    flutter run
    ```

### Key Libraries

- `http`: For making network requests.
- `url_launcher`: For opening external links.
- `google_fonts`: For typography.

## Workflow

To update the app's data:
1.  Run the backend scraper script.
2.  Re-build or hot-restart the Flutter app to load the new JSON data from assets.
