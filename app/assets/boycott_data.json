We have confirmed that this was the act of a single U.S. franchisee and not reflective of the entire company. There are no Dunkin locations in Israel. We have them on Caution because the owner, Roark Capital is a $37 billion investment fund run by Neal Aronson, that has bought out many restaurant and other franchise concepts. We cannot safely say whether the investors in this fund are supporters of Israel. Therefore, it is best to avoid these national chains and support local businesses.",

This is difficult considering that Hamdi Ulukaya has done so much amazing humanitarian work, especially with refugee populations. He seems to be ignoring one of the most significant refugee crisis of our time, created as a result of the Occupation of Palestine. Although we hope he is working behind the scenes to help, now is not a time to remain silent. He has not responded to our email asking for an explanation. We urge you all to join our effort to ask him to speak in support of Palestine by contacting the company by phone, email, and social media.",

Although their products are sold in Israel, the company put out a statement on Jan 8/2024 calling for Ceasefire, ending US aid for the war, and acknowledging the historical context of Occupation that led to Oct 7. While the company was founded in 1948 by self-proclaimed Zionist Emmanuel Bronner, it has evolved through two generations to become a champion of social justice everywhere, including Palestine. It sources 90% of the olive oil used in its products from Canaan, a Palestinian owned company near Jenin that works closely with the Palestine Fair Trade Association and its 1700 small farmers. The other 10% of its olive oil is sourced from Sindyanna, a fair trade business run by Arab and Jewish women in Israel.",
